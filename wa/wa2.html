    <h2>My Goals For This Class Include...</h2>
        <p>Kicking ass and taking names in all things Web Dev & Web Design.</p>
        <p>But for real, I do want to learn about standards in web design and how to push the limits in what is possible. I have a lot of ideas.</p>

    <h3>My Favorite YouTube Video Is...</h3>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0GcXV2njY">"What Becomes of The Broken Hearted" LIVE: with Joan Osborne & The Funk Brothers</a>
        <p><b>context here:</b> The Funk Brothers INVENTED the "motown" sound (rarely getting credit for this). This concert was a big deal with all of them coming back together to play live</p> 
        <p>I came across this video in a History of Rock & Roll class I took long ago</p>
