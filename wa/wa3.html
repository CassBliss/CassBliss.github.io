    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>Trametes versicolor also known as Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor 
            is a common polypore mushroom found throughout the world. Meaning 'of several colors', 
            versicolor reliably describes this fungus that displays a variety of colors. 
            For example, because its shape and multiple colors are similar to those of a wild turkey, T. versicolor
            is commonly called turkey tail. A similar looking mushroom, commonly called false turkey tail, which is 
            from a different order, may sometimes be confused with the turkey tail mushroom due to appearance. Another 
            lookalike is the multicolor gill polypore.

        <p>The top surface of the cap shows typical concentric zones of different 
            colors, and the margin is always the lightest. Underneath a layer of 
            tomentum is a black layer, topping the whitish flesh. The flesh itself 
            is 1-3 mm thick and has a leathery texture. Older specimens, such as the 
            one pictured, can have zones with green algae growing on them, thus appearing green. 
            It commonly grows in tiled layers in groups or rows on logs and stumps of 
            deciduous trees, and is common in North America. The mushroom is stalkless 
            and the cap is rust-brown or darker brown, sometimes with black zones. The cap is flat,
             up to 8 x 5 x 0.5-1 cm in area. It is often triangular or round, with zones of fine hairs. 
             The pore surface is whitish to light brown, with pores round and with age twisted and labyrinthine. 
             3-8 pores per millimeter.

        <h3>Polysaccharide-K extract</h3>
            <p>Polysaccharide-K (PSK or krestin), extracted from T. versicolor, is considered safe for 
                use as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatment in Japan where it is known as kawaratake (roof tile mushroom) 
                and approved for clinical use. As a glycoprotein mixture, PSK has been studied in clinical 
                research in people with various cancers and immune deficiencies, but its efficacy remains inconclusive, 
                as of 2022. In some countries, PSK is sold as a dietary supplement.
                Use of PSK may cause adverse effects, such as diarrhea, darkened feces, or darkened finger nails.
